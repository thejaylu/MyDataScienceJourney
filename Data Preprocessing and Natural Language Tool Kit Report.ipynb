    "##### Null Values\n",
    "It was identified that columns 'days_employed' and 'total_income' had null values through a loop that checked for null values and validated with the .count() method. These were remedied by replacing them with the median values of their respective column. Possible cases of this is from human error of the data input or an error from exporting the data to a csv file. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unreasonable zero values\n",
    "Through manual checking using the .loc method and condition ==0, we also found that column 'dob_years' had values of zero in them. This was modified into empty string values. I believe the possible case with this is from a technical error where it was supposed to take the delta between today's date and their date of birth, but had a calculation issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unreasonable negative values \n",
    "Through manual checking using the .value_counts() method on column 'children', I found a negative value for it. This does not make sense because you can not have negative children. I remedied this by locating all items within the column that was equal to -1 and changed it to 1. I believe it was most likely a technical issue from exporting of the csv file or calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Outlier data\n",
    "The distribution of the column 'days_employed' showed extremely high values that were far from the rest of the values. These values were identified to be 300k+ days which translates to over 800 years which is unreasonable. This was remedied by finding all values that were greater than 300000 days and replacing them with the median value. It is possible it could have been a human error from inputting too many numbers. It is more likely for it to be a technical error from exporting of the csv file or calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept is applied to the high number of counts of people who have 20 children. I would believe this if there were a smaller amount and more counts of children inbetween 5 and 20. This was remedied by changing values of 20 children to 2. This is most likely a human error accidentally inputting a zero afterwards."

This loop provided the value_counts to let me manually see if there were any duplicates in these columns. I was able to visually identify that 'education' and 'purpose' had duplicated entries. The issues were case-sensitivity and different wording respectively for the columns.\n",

    "By taking the average of how many clients who have defaulted on their debt grouped by the number of children they have, we get a ratio of how likely each bucket would pay their debt on time. Overall it seems like all counts of children have a low likely of not repaying their loan on time with 0.0976 being the highest ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a slight increase of likelihood to default on their debt from groups of children from 0 to 2, but there is only a delta of 0.019662 between them which is still important to notice. The ratio actually decreases at counts of 3 children, but then rises back at 4, which shows there is only a slightly positive relation. The counts of each group decreases for greater numbers of children (which makes sense since it's difficult to have a big family) so the reliability of the data decreases as well. We should not consider counts of 5 children because we only have 9 rows with this kind of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data makes sense because those who do not have children have less financial responsibility compared to those raising a family, so they will be more likely to pay a loan back on time. Having 1 or 2 children adds more fiscal pressure and makes it more difficult to pay a loan back on time. From 3 children and onwards, the count of these entries start to become scarce, but still slightly follows the same idea that more children slightly increases likeliness to not pay debt on time. "

From all the martial status categories, there is a range of 0.065 to 0.097 of the averages of paying debt on time. We can see that there is a relation with the high range that are based on buckets. The highest liklihood to not pay debt on time is for the 'unmarried' category of 0.974. My hypothesis is that many young adults are unmarried and are irresponsible with paying back their debt.\n",
